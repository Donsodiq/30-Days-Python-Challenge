# 30-Days-Python-Challenge
Tracking my 30-day Python coding challenge
Day 1 task done and it was super easy. 
Playing around the common data types in Python

#The train is moving, Alliamdulilahi
It's the third day and I learnt about loping. Basically, I leanrt the Conditional statements (for example: if, elif, and else). Also, I leanred the chained condition and the Nested statement. It's going smoothly and I so much love the vibes. 
I am preparing for the fourth day of the challenge now. 
During the fourth day, I will be learning the following: While loops, List, tuples, and iterations. I hope to achieve all this and carry out some relevant exercises.
