# 30-Days-Python-Challenge
Tracking my 30-day Python coding challenge
Day 1 task done, and it was super easy. 
Playing around with the common data types in Python

#Day_2 task achieved. However, it was full of revision because I am already familiar with the Python basics. 
#The train is moving, Alliamdulilahi
It's the third day, and I've learned about loping. I knew the Conditional statements (for example: if, elif, and else). Also, I realized the chained condition and the Nested statement. It's going smoothly, and I love the vibes so much. 
I am now preparing for the fourth day of the challenge. 
During the fourth day, I will be learning the following: While loops, lists, tuples, and iterations. I hope to achieve all this and carry out some relevant exercises.
